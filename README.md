## ❓ FAQ

### Is SafeFonts GDPR compliant?

Yes! SafeFonts hosts all fonts locally on your server at `wp-content/uploads/safefonts/`, so no data is sent to external services like Google Fonts. This makes it fully GDPR compliant.

### Which font format should I use?

WOFF2 is recommended for best compression and modern browser support. You can also upload WOFF as a fallback for older browsers.

### How many fonts can I upload?

There's no limit, but keep in mind that too many fonts can affect site performance. Only upload fonts you actually use.

### Can I use these fonts in page builders?

SafeFonts Free works with Gutenberg. For page builder support (Elementor, Bricks, Beaver Builder, Divi, Oxygen), upgrade to [SafeFonts Pro](https://safefonts.com).

### Where are fonts stored?

Fonts are stored in `wp-content/uploads/safefonts/` directory and registered in the WordPress database. This location survives plugin updates and reinstallation.
